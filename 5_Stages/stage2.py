# Stage 2: Variables and User Interaction
# Learning: variables, input(), string formatting, basic data types

# Getting user information
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")
favorite_color = input("What's your favorite color? ")

# Displaying personalized information
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"Your favorite color is {favorite_color}.")

# Simple calculations
birth_year = 2025 - int(age)
print(f"You were born in approximately {birth_year}.")

# Let's be creative
print("ðŸŽ‰ Nice to meet you, " + name + "!")
